# Concrete Crack Detector App

This app is an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network trained for classifing images of cracked and non-cracked concrete images.

The user selects an image of a concrete surface with cracks, and then the model predicts the presence or absence of concrete cracks in each position of a sliding window that passes over the selected image. The result is shown below:
